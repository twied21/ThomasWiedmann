Here is a quick guide on changing Fusion360 settings, more specifically using the Eagle Options File.

I have a file I worked on for Fusion that will change some settings so that we have standard color schemes across the team. Please follow the direction in the file for how to install it. I will also place those instruction here.
Navigate to the path below (Need to have hidden folders turned on)
C:\Users[your username]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Neutron Platform\Options[Alphanumeric String]
Copy old file named 'electronoptiongroup_eagle.rc' to your desktop and replace with this file
If Fusion does not reopen after changing this file, revert to the original
